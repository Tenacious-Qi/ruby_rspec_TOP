# The files for this example (#15) builds on the TDD files from #14.
# The FindNumber class is now called BinarySearch, which is a more accurate
# description.

# After TDD is complete, the classes and methods that were used as a test
# double, should be updated to be a 'verifying double' Using a 'verifying
# double' is preferred, because they will produce an error if does not exist
# on the actual class.

# https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/v/3-9/docs/verifying-doubles

# It is common for method and variable names to change during development.
# For example, random_number.value could change to rand_num.number

# Therefore, using a 'verifying double' makes a test more stable.

# Unit testing relies on using doubles to test the object in isolation (not
# dependant on any other object). One important concept to understand is the
# BinarySearch or FindNumber class doesn't care if it is given an actual
# random_number class object. It only cares that it is given an object that
# can respond to certain methods. This concept is called polymorphism

# In the file, 14_find_number, you wrote tests for #make_guess, #game_over?, and
# #update_range. We will not re-write them for this example. If you'd like to
# see them again, they are at the bottom of this file.
