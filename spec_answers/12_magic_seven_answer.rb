# Before learning any more complexities to testing, let's take a look at a
# standard testing pattern - Arrange Act, and Assert.
# https://youtu.be/sCthIEOaMI8

# 1. Arrange -> set-up the test (examples: initializing objects, let
#               variables, updating values of instance variables, etc.)
# 2. Act ->     executing the logic to test (example: calling a method to run).
# 3. Assert ->  expect the results of arrange & act.

# The tests in this example are fairly easy to understand and may seem
# ridiculous to use A-A-A. However, tests should be easily understood by
# someone that is not familiar with the code.

# NOTE: When you start using A-A-A to format your tests, it will feel
# counter-intuitive to DRY (don't repeat yourself). Creating tests that are
# easy to read is very important, therefore using repetition is neccessary.
# When you start working on a existing code base, you will often become familiar
# with the code by reading the tests.

      # However, the above test is NOT very readable. For example, it does not
      # explain where '6' came from. Therefore, let's start with explaining
      # where '6' came from as part of the 'Arrange' step.

      # nine to the random_number.

      # For the 'Assert' step, we know exactly we expect the result to be:
      expect(result).to eq(15)
    end
  end
  # In addition, using a context to explain the conditions of the test makes
  # the output more read-able.
