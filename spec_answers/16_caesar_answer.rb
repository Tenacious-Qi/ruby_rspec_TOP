# Let's write tests for an entire class & the included module.

# If you have watched the 'Magic Tricks of Testing' video, you will know that
# you do not have to test every single method in unit testing. Methods do not
# need to be tested if they are only sent to self or if it only sends an
# outgoing query message.
# https://youtu.be/URSWYvyc42M

# However, testing every method in this example offers good practice and
# introduces a few new concepts.

  subject(:phrase) { described_class.new('Ebiil, Tloia!') }

  # You do not need to test #initialize if it is only creating instance
  # variables. This can cause the test to be fragile, breaking anytime an
  # instance variable name is changed.

  # To test #decrypt, we will need to move 'Assert' before 'Act' again.

  # MODULE TESTING: There are several ways to test methods inside a module.

  # Some prefer explicitly including it in the configuration option.
  # https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/helper-methods/define-helper-methods-in-a-module

  # Some prefer testing modules using a dummy class.
  # https://mixandgo.com/learn/how-to-test-ruby-modules-with-rspec

  # Modules can also be tested in a class that includes it, which is how the
  # following tests work.
