# For this assignment you will be doing TDD for 3 methods - #make_guess,
# #make_guess, and #update_range.

# After you have some experience using TDD, you can use the typical
# Red-Green-Refactor workflow.
# https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/videos/red-green-refactor-by-example

# Since this is probably your first experience with TDD, let's extend the
# workflow to include a few more steps:
# 1. Read & understand the requirement for one method at a time.
# 2. Write one test for that method that you think will pass.
# 3. Write the method that fulfills the requirement.
# 4. Run the test that you wrote. If it doesn't pass, re-do steps 1-3.
# 5. When your first test is passing, write the additional tests.
# 6. Run all of the tests. If they all don't pass, re-do steps 3-5.
# 7. Optional: Refactor your code and/or tests, with all tests passing.
